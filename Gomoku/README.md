## Gomoku

This is a game called Gomoku in Python using classes. Gomoku is an abstract
strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go
board with 15x15 intersections. 

The black plays first if white did not win in the previous game, and players alternate
in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an
unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
